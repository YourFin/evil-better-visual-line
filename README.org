* Evil Better Visual Line
[[http://melpa.org/#/evil-better-visual-line][file:http://melpa.org/packages/evil-better-visual-line-badge.svg]]

This package solves the tiny problem that binding ~j~ to ~gj~ and ~k~ to ~gk~ causes
in visual line mode: you can end up with unnecessary key presses.

All this package does is bind ~j~ and ~k~ to visual line moves,
except in visual line mode and visual block mode, where they move on source file lines.
This is generally desirable behavior as moving a partial line in visual line mode
can never change the selection size, and partial lines in visual block mode more often
than not change the width of the selection in undesirable ways. It provides three commands:

 - ~evil-better-visual-line-next-line~, which preforms the described behavior for moving down lines
 - ~evil-better-visual-line-previous-line~, which preforms the described behavior for moving up lines
 - ~evil-better-visual-line-on~, which provides a convenient shortcut to rebinding ~j~ and ~k~ appropriately

** Installation

*** Melpa:
Install from MELPA directly with ~M-x package-install evil-better-visual-line~.
See the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]] for details about how to set up MELPA if you have not already done so.

**** use-package
     I would recommend jwiegley's excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to install if you can:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-better-visual-line
  :ensure t
  :config
  (evil-better-visual-line-on))
#+END_SRC

*** Manually:
Download with:
#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:YourFin/evil-better-visual-line.git
#+end_src

Make sure that the resulting folder is in your load path.
Example in ~.emacs.d/init.el~ for .emacs.d/evil-better-visual-line:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/evil-better-visual-mave"))
#+end_src

Random folder on your system:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/evil-better-visual-mave")
#+end_src

And then turn it on:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'evil-better-visual-line)
(evil-better-visual-line-on)
#+end_src
